We have a `Makefile` provided some commands:

## Guide for adding a new storage

- Add a new storage in `storages/` folder, you can follow the `storages/gcs.go` as an example.
    - If the storage is a AWS S3 compatible storage, you can use `storages/s3.go` as a base.
- Add a new test file in `tests/` folder, you can follow the `tests/oss.yml` as an example.
    - Don't put your credentials in the test file, you can use environment variables to pass them.
